PROJECT TITLE: Project 1
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Practice recursion
VERSION or DATE: 3/4/2022
AUTHORS: Keith Thoong & Samuel Ayoade

STATE OF THIS PROJECT: Completed and fully tested

PROCESS DESCRIPTION:

This project was challenging because we had contained most of the program's functions in one larger
method, making it more diffucult to trace. We also struggled with finding the bounds of what are base case
would be. In future projects we will make more use of helper methods in order to break our functions
down into sections that are easier to trace. Overall the project was challenging, but rewarding when 
we had completed it.
